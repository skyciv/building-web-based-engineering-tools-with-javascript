## Simply Supported Beam Analysis

### Overview

This calculator performs analysis on a simply supported beam carrying a uniformly distributed load. Users can find the reaction force and peak shear force/bending moment in the beam.

If users know the Youngs Modulus (E) and Moment of Inertia (Iz) of the beam, the deflection of the beam can also be calculated.
