## Simply Supported Beam Analysis

### Overview

This calculator performs analysis on a simply supported beam with a uniformly distributed load. Users can find the peak shear force, reaction force and bending moment in the beam.

If users know the elastic modulus (E) and second moment of area (I<sub>z</sub>) of the beam, deflection can also be calculated.

### Assumptions
1. This calculator assumes beams are <b>uniform</b> stiffness and C.S. area.
2. Beam is assumed to remain <u>elastic</u> under applied loading.
3. In-plane tension and compression forces are ignored in this calculator.
